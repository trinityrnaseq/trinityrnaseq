= Trinity: Abundance Estimation Using RSEM or eXpress, and Visualization Using IGV =

link:../index.html[Trinity-home]

Trinity supports the use of either http://deweylab.biostat.wisc.edu/rsem/[RSEM] or http://bio.math.berkeley.edu/eXpress/[eXpress] for transcript abundance estimation (ie. computing expression values). Be sure to download the software and make it available via our PATH setting.

To compute abundance estimates, the original reads (not in silico normalized) are aligned to the Trinity transcripts using either http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/index.shtml[bowtie(1)] or http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml[bowtie2]. Then, either RSEM or eXpress are executed to estimate expression values based on the resulting alignments.

The Trinity toolkit comes with a script to faciliate this process:

If you have strand-specific data, be sure to include the '--SS_lib_type' parameter.

[NOTE]
It is useful to first run 'align_and_estimate_abundance.pl' to only prep your reference database for alignment, using '--prep_reference', and then subsequently running it on each of your sets of reads in parallel to obtain sample-specific abundance estimates.



[[alignment_output]]
== Alignment output (bam) ==
The alignment step generates the file 'bowtie.bam', which is then fed directly into either RSEM or eXpress.  Note, the alignment step also generates a 'bowtie.csorted.bam' file, which is a coordinate-sorted bam file that can be used for visualization using IGV (see below).

[[RSEM_output]]
== RSEM output ==
The RSEM computation generates two primary output files containing the abundance estimation information:

  RSEM.isoforms.results  : EM read counts per Trinity transcript
  RSEM.genes.results     : EM read counts on a per-Trinity-component (aka... gene) basis, 'gene' used loosely here.


The output for the isoforms file looks like so:

[[how_many_expr]]
== How many expressed genes or transcripts do I have? ==

Presumably, a transcript is expressed if it has been assembled from RNA-Seq data, but as we know, transcription can be quite pervasive, and many transcripts, particularly the very lowly expressed ones, have questionable biological significance.  Note that some transcripts may have artificially low (or zero) expression values simply because they are incompletely assembled and do not recruit both pairs of PE reads in order to be properly accounted for during abundance estimation.  If we assume that most biologically relevant transcripts are reasonably well assembled and well quantified by the abundance estimation method used, we might infer the approximate number of expressed genes or transcripts as the number that are expressed above some minimum expression threshold.

Given an RSEM output file, you can plot the number of genes (or transcripts) that are expressed above a minimum FPKM expression threshold like so.

Generate a data file containing the minimum fpkm threshold and count of features (genes or transcripts) by running the following on your gene or transcript RSEM output file:

  $TRINITY_HOME/util/misc/count_features_given_MIN_FPKM_threshold.pl RSEM.genes.results > cumul_counts.txt

which will generate output like so:
[options='header']
|============================
|neg_min_fpkm    |num_features
|-15510  |1
|-15260  |2
|-11615  |3
|-11459  |4
|... skipping many lines    |... 
|-5  |9730
|-4  |11806
|-3  |15310
|-2  |23685
|-1  |47930
|0   |1388798
|===========================   

The above table indicates that we have at least 23,685 'genes' expressed by at least 2 FPKM (after first rounding FPKM values).

The data can be plotted using your favorite utility. If you choose to use R, you might do it like so:

   R
   >data = read.table("cumul_counts.txt", header=T)
   >plot(data, xlim=c(-10,0), ylim=c(0,50000), xlab='-1*minFPKM', ylab='cumul gene count', type='b', main='gene count vs. minFPKM')

which would generate the following plot:

image:../images/genes_vs_minFPKM_plot.png["genes_vs_minFPKM", float='left']

You can see that, in my current sample, we have over 1.3 million 'genes', but only a fraction of them (47,930) are expressed at least by 1 FPKM (after rounding the FPKM values).  

If we want higher precision in the number of genes expressed between 0 and 1 FPKM, we can count them by running a filter on the RSEM output file like so:

  cat RSEM.genes.results | sed '1,1d' | awk '$7 >= 0.1' |wc -l

  84097

To reproduce one of the numbers in the above table, it would look like so:

  cat RSEM.genes.results | sed '1,1d' | awk 'int($7 + 0.5) >= 2' |wc -l

  23685

Ultimately, the most biologically relevant transcription is this particular case is probably ~30k genes, but of course, this is highly subjective, as is the definition of a gene itself and what many would consider to be biologically relevant. Simpler operational definitions can suffice here as part of generating bulk statistics.


[[filtering_transcripts]]
== Filtering lowly supported transcripts (using RSEM output files) ==

If you want to filter out the likely transcript artifacts and lowly expressed transcripts, you might consider retaining only those that represent at least 1% of the per-component (IsoPct) expression level.  Because Trinity transcripts are not currently scaffolded across sequencing gaps, there will be cases where smaller transcript fragments may lack enough properly-paired read support to show up as 'expressed', but are still otherwise supported by the read data.  Therefore, filter cautiously and we don't recommend discarding such lowly expressed (or seemingly unexpressed) transcripts, but rather putting them aside for further study.

The utility script 'TRINITY_RNASEQ_ROOT/util/filter_fasta_by_rsem_values.pl' can be used to filter your FASTA file of assembled transcripts using the RSEM values within the RSEM.isoforms.results file, according to min IsoPct, min FPKM, and min TPM.  Note, you can provide a list of RSEM output files, one for each sample, and filter out those transcripts that do not meet the specified requirements in any of the samples given.

[[running_express]]
== Running eXpress ==

If parameter setting '--est_method eXpress' is used, eXpress will be run, and files generated will include:

  results.xprs : the primary eXpress output file, containing expression values for transcripts.
  results.xprs.genes : a 'genes' expression output file, generated by the Trinity toolkit, based on the eXpress transcript results.

Note, the 'results.xprs.genes' file content is formatted identically to the 'results.xprs' file, but limited in data content to the length, counts, and FPKM expression values. The remainder of the fields are set to 'NA'.

== Sample Data ==

Under 'TRINITY_RNASEQ_ROOT/sample_data/test_Trinity_Assembly', execute 

  % runMe.sh 1

to first build Trinity transcript assemblies using the sample data, and then run through the downstream alignment and abundance estimation steps.


[[Visualization]]
== Visualization of Aligned Reads Using IGV ==

The Trinity Transcripts and read alignments can be visualized using the http://www.broadinstitute.org/igv/[Integrated Genomics Viewer].

Just import the Trinity.fasta file as a 'genome', and load up the coordinate-sorted bam file containing the aligned reads (bowtie.csorted.bam).  A screenshot below shows how the data are displayed:

image:../images/IGV_Trinity_screenshot.png[Trinity_in_IGV]

[[detailed_assessment]]
== Detailed Assessment of Read Content of the Assembly ==

The above methods for quantitation rely on sets of properly paired reads.  However, it is sometimes the case that certain (usually small) reconstructed transcript fragments can capture alignments to individual reads but not to both paired reads of RNA-Seq fragments.  By running the process below, both the single-end and propery paired reads can be captured, counted, and visualized:

  $TRINITY_HOME/util/bowtie_PE_separate_then_join.pl --seqType fq --left left.fq --right right.fq \
                  --target Trinity.fasta --aligner bowtie -- -p 4 --all --best --strata -m 300


As usual, if you have strand-specific RNA-Seq data, indicate this with the '--SS_lib_type' parameter.

An output directory 'bowtie_out' is created and should include the files:

  bowtie_out.nameSorted.bam  : alignments sorted by read name
  bowtie_out.coordSorted.bam : alignments sorted by coordinate.


To get alignment statistics, run the following on the name-sorted bam file:

   $TRINITY_HOME/util/SAM_nameSorted_to_uniq_count_stats.pl bowtie_out/bowtie_out.nameSorted.bam

 #read_type  count   pct
 proper_pairs    47042   83.59  (left and right reads align to the same transcript)
 improper_pairs  6824    12.13  (left and right reads align, but to different transcripts)
 left_only   1300    2.31 
 right_only  1110    1.97
 
 Total aligned reads: 56276  (counting individual reads of pairs, each read counts only once).


You can load up the 'bowtie_out.coordSorted.bam' file into IGV for visualization.
